Grading Level:
Same grade for all members.

Differences:
None.

Special Instructions:
- Our application requires a camera to test the "joining a Private Channel with QR code" feature. We simulated this application on an actual iPhone device and the feature works perfectly. When testing this feature, please run the application on an iPhone, as the simulator will only provide an alert error message. 
- On the other hand, sending photo messages on a real iPhone device introduces a unique error with the photo library URL scheme, so sending photo messages only works within the simulator. However, since sending photos is an extra feature that we decided to implement and never committed to in our mockups or app idea paper, Professor Seitsinger has stated that this would not affect our grade negatively. When testing this additional feature (sending photos), please use the simulator.
